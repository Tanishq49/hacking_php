# 🌐 PHP Learning Playground by Tanishq Bhandari

Welcome to the **PHP Practice Repository**, a curated collection of foundational PHP scripts created by **Tanishq49 (aka Trifalic Hacker)**.

This repository is designed for **learning, testing, and mastering PHP basics** — from arrays and form handling to GET requests and more. Whether you're a beginner or revisiting PHP fundamentals, this serves as a hands-on resource to sharpen your server-side development skills.

> 💡 All scripts are beginner-friendly, modular, and easy to run with a local server (like `php -S`, XAMPP, or LAMP).
